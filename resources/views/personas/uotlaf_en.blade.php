        Uotlaf <a class="link" href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=u%C9%94tlaf&voice=Vitoria">/uɔtlafɪ/uɔtlaf/</a>
        (stylized 'uotlaf') is my main <a class="link" href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Fursona">fursona</a>.

        He is a <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_fox">Arctic fox</a> with all the
        characteristics (and problems) that I have. This includes having a good long-term memory, sticking to a subject
        for a very long time and looking up everything about it, hating anything that makes loud noises (I hate you,
        horn-blowers and fireworks), not stopping for a second without <a class="link"
                                                                          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pica_(disorder)">put
            something in your mouth</a>, love reading wikis (waste a lot of time reading from page to page) and love <a
            class="link" href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog">Sonic</a>.
    </p>
    <p> Like every arctic
        fox (or some in <a class="link" href="https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Fandom">furry fandom</a>), It changes
        the color of its coat and markings depending on the time of year: At first, its coat is almost bluish-white and
        has markings on its snout, ear tips, toes and the ends of its tail. From the middle of the year, its coat
        changes to a brownish-brown color and it gains a marking that runs from its mouth to its belly.
    </p>
    <p>As for
        socializing, he prefers to be alone most of the time. With exceptions with people who are very close to him, his
        responses to people he doesn't know are usually very short for fear of saying too much (as has happened several
        times) and being found annoying or hurting someone. Despite this, he loves his close friends and tries to help
        them as much as he can.

    <p>
        He is passionate about computing, but does not have a well-defined area
